# Fraud Detection System for UID Aadhaar

## 📌 Project Overview
This project, developed during the Infosys internship, focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in the UID Aadhaar system using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify anomalies and prevent identity fraud by leveraging data analytics and AI-driven approaches.

## 🔍 Features
- **Real-time fraud detection** using AI models
- **Anomaly detection** with machine learning algorithms
- **Data validation** to ensure Aadhaar authenticity
- **Secure data handling** with encryption techniques
- **Scalable architecture** for large-scale Aadhaar verification

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Database:** MySQL / MongoDB
- **Frameworks:** Flask / FastAPI for API development
- **Cloud Services:** AWS / Azure for deployment

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/infosys-fraud-detection.git
   cd infosys-fraud-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```sh
   export DATABASE_URL='your_database_url'
   export API_KEY='your_api_key'
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## 📊 Model Training
To train the fraud detection model:
```sh
python train.py --dataset data/aadhaar_fraud.csv --epochs 50
```

## 🛡️ Security Measures
- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted before storage
- **Access Control:** Role-based access management
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Tracks unauthorized access attempts

## 📖 Documentation
For detailed API endpoints and usage, refer to the [API Documentation](docs/API.md).

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Enhancing AI model accuracy with deep learning
- Integration with blockchain for improved security
- Real-time alert system for fraudulent activities
